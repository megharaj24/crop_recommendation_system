# IoT-based-Crop-Recommendation-System

IoT-based-Crop-Recommendation-System:- This project involves the use of sensors to collect data from agricultural fields and predict the best crop to grow in each field using machine learning. The project utilizes the following technologies: Arduino IDE for coding the sensors Thingspeak cloud server for storing the sensor data Streamlit app for building the user interface Machine learning algorithm for crop prediction

How to Use the Crop Prediction Model:- 
Hardware Setup: Connect the sensors to the Arduino board and upload the code to the board using the Arduino IDE. The code will read the sensor data and send it to the Thingspeak cloud server.

Data Collection: The Thingspeak cloud server will collect the data and store it in the form of a graph. The data can be analyzed and visualized on the Thingspeak website.

Crop Prediction: The machine learning model uses the data collected from the sensors to predict the best crop to grow in each field. The model is integrated with the Streamlit app, which provides an easy-to-use interface for inputting the data and obtaining the crop prediction.

User Interface: To use the Streamlit app, simply run the app. The app will display the predicted crop for each field based on the sensor data.

Requirements:- NodeMCU ESP8266 Sensors (DHT11, raindrop and moisture), Arduino IDE ,Thingspeak cloud server account ,Streamlit app ,Python environment ,Machine learning algorithm (e.g., Random Forest, Decision Tree)

Installation:- Arduino IDE can be downloaded from the official website. Thingspeak cloud server account can be created on the Thingspeak website. Streamlit app can be installed using pip: pip install streamlit. The required Python libraries can be installed using pip: pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn.

Conclusion:- This project demonstrates how sensors and machine learning can be used to improve crop yields and make agriculture more efficient. By using sensor data to predict the best crop to grow in each field, farmers can optimize their production and reduce waste. The user-friendly interface provided by the Streamlit app makes it easy for farmers to input their data and obtain crop predictions, even if they have no experience with machine learning.
